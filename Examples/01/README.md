Example 01.

Just double click rep.exe or run it from the console.

You should get a file **output.txt** with the contents *storeThis in a file* as a result.

If you double click twice, it will append this to the same file.

If you change **storeFile** in 01.rep to **restoreFile** it will overwrite each time instead.

That's it!
